            <h3>Project-1:    TEXT SUMMARIZATION </h3>
            <p>Text Summarizer is a user-friendly web application using Deep Learning Concepts. It generates concise summaries of uploaded documents, simplifying information retrieval for users. Text summarization condenses text to its core meaning, capturing main ideas without specific details. Techniques include extractive methods (combining existing sentences) and abstractive methods (generating new sentences). Summarization is used in news, document, and research paper summaries, enabling quick understanding without reading the entire text.</p>
